Copy LCweapons_xxxx.u (xxxx being current version) and LCweapons.int to (UT)\System folder
Run the mutator LCWeapons_xxxx.LCMutator and don't forget to add said package to ServerPackages.
If you're running XC_GameEngine version 11 or above, it isn't necessary to use ServerPackages setting.

If there's an arena mutator the LCWeapons knows of, also load it and LCWeapons will attempt to do it's job.


===========
Before doing any changes, you should request for my assistance first.
I may get said changes up on a global release.


===========
SiegeIV version 12 and onwards:
Suppliers will detect LCWeapons, no need to edit settings

Older Siege:
The advanced weapon replacement system makes it so that player spawns with all weapons without any INI changes
Buildable weapons, or Skaarj weapons (if spawned after frame 0) will work as well.

Suppliers only do exact type checks, so these changes will be necessary on the Siege INI:
[Supplier Class Here]
Weapons[0]=LCWeapons_xxxx.LCEnforcer
Weapons[2]=LCWeapons_xxxx.LCShockRifle
Weapons[5]=LCWeapons_xxxx.LCMinigun2
Weapons[8]=LCWeapons_xxxx.LCSniperRifle

===========
MonsterHunt:

bEnableMHhack is set to True by default so monsters are taken as LC targets on older MH versions.
If your MH version doesn't rely on preventing monsters from being polled by the mutator chain disable this setting.
